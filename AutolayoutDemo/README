1.SiblingElem and UIScrollView are from this article(http://www.gfzj.us/tech/2015/03/11/iOS-AutoLayout.html).
2.~~For ALDynamicView, as I'm still puzzled by this problem(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34369427/can-i-set-the-property-for-a-class-which-hasnt-been-specified-until-run-in-oc), you can't directly set `lineAdded` from detail controller. While you can use `e self.lineAdded = YES` in console to change the value.(1219)~~
    The issue above has been fixed by manitos in SOF and it's OK now. BTW, it feels so terrific to attract manitos to answer my question! LOL.
